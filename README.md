# Random library

In this assignment, we will explore a new library called random! We can then apply it to concepts we've learned about in the past.

The first thing we can do is import the random library:
```
import random
```

Just like we imported the turtle library, we can do the same with random. This allows us to use different functions that normally wouldn't be available to us. Let's first try out a function called random.randint(), and let's store it as variable x and print it to the console:
```
x = random.randint(0,100)
print(x)
```
Copy and paste this code into your python file to see what it does!




Function methods you will learn about and use in this assignment:
random.randint()  
random.seed()  
random.randrange()  
random.uniform()  
random.choice()
